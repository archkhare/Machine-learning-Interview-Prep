# Machine-learning-Interview-Prep
This is a repository where I will document my machine learning interview prep over the next couple of months. 
Here I will take all the myriad of resources scattered over the internet and build a coherent learning path.
This will compromise of coding practice, statstics and probability, machine learning, deep learning algorithms as well as interview questions.
Hopefully this will be helpful to people preparing for the interview.
I will use freely avialable resources on the internet to do this.
Cheers!

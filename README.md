# Data-Scientist-Interview-Prep
This is a repository where I will document my machine learning interview prep over the next couple of months. 
Here I will take all the myriad of resources scattered over the internet and build a coherent learning path.
This will compromise of coding practice, statstics and probability, machine learning, deep learning algorithms as well as interview questions.
I will add a file on daily basis
This will serve two purpose will help me pratice active recall, develop a repository of actual DS prep process for future refrence.
Hopefully this will be helpful to people preparing for the interview.
I will use freely avialable resources on the internet to do this.
Cheers!
